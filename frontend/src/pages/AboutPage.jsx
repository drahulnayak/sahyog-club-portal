          <p>
            Established around <strong>2017</strong> at NIT Raipur, <strong>SAHYOG – The Mentorship Club</strong> was born from a simple yet profound vision: to create a supportive ecosystem where every student feels guided, supported, and uplifted. We are the bridge between juniors and seniors, a guiding light that helps freshers navigate the exciting yet challenging waters of college life—academically, emotionally, and socially.
